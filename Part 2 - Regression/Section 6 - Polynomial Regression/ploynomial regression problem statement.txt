we are HR team working for a big company and we are about to hire new employee in this company.
so this new empl seems to be great, good fit for the job and we are about to make an offer to this potential new employee
nad now it's time to negotiate on what's going to be the salary of this new future employee.

At the begining of the negotiatian, he is telling that he had 20+ yr of exp and was earning 160K+ salary in his prev company, so he's asking 
for atleastmore than 160K.

However ther's somone in the control in the HR team and always try to be detective and certainly decides to previous employer to check the info
But unfortunaley all the info the senior HR got is the dataset of 10 different positions in the company.

So this HR member runs a simple analysis on excel or google sheet and observes a non-linear relation b/w position and salary.

However this HR perdon could get an another very related info.

One info that he was working as Region manager for 2yr &it takes 4yr for promotion

Build a bluffing detector using regression model(Polynomial) and predict if this new emoloyee is bluffing abot his salary.
