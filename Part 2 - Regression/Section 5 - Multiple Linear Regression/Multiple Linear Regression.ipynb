    "### **The challenge -** \n",
    "\n",
    "Ther's a vent capitalist fund that has hired you as a Data Scientist to analyze this dataset of company and create a model that\n",
    "will tell the vent capitalist fund which types of companies it is most interested in investing.\n",

    "This is a sample and they are looking for / they want to understand whethe company performed better in New York or in California, all others thing held equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Or** \n",
    "<p>Which company performed better if you hold state columns equal , will the company spending more on Marketin performs better or a company spending less on marketing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Also the main thing probably they want to understand : how do they assess company \n",
    "do the company spend more on R&D or  the company spending more on Marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So which of these 2 spend yields better result of profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "And based on my model that I created , they will setup guidelines for their own vent capitalist fund . For example,\n",
    "Ok so we are more interested in company that work in new york and that have a very low Administration spend\n",
    "and a very high R&D spend .\n",
